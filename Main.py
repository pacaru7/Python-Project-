    This function sets the player parameters, using the methods setName()
    and setCountry() from the class Player() in the Classes.py file. It does 
    not return any value but is designed to take as input the name and the 
    country of the player. 
    
    The name of the player can be any type of string or even number 
    constellation. The country of the player ignores letter case and can 
    only take the country name (e.g. Germany) as opposed to the nationality
    (German) as input.
    
    The objects of the class are specified in Classes.py file.
